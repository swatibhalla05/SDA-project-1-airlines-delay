# SDA-project-1-airlines-delay

# Dataset Description
The dataset focuses on airline and airport performance metrics. It includes:

Time Dimensions: Year, Month, and Date for flight delays.
Airports & Airlines: Specific identifiers and names for airports and airlines.
Delay Causes: Categorization into Carrier, Late Aircraft, Weather, Security, and National Aviation System.
Flight Details: Total flights, delayed flights, diverted flights, and canceled flights.
Delay Durations: Minutes delayed for each category (e.g., weather, security).

# Key Insights from the Dashboard

Monthly Delay Patterns: Total delays show fluctuations throughout the year, with visible spikes in specific months, possibly due to seasonal weather conditions or increased travel demand.

Top Airports with Delays: Airports like Washington Dulles and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International show the highest delays. These are likely high-traffic hubs, emphasizing the need for capacity enhancements or better delay management.

Causes of Delays: Carrier-related and Late Aircraft delays are the most significant contributors. Weather delays, though smaller in volume, show a seasonal pattern with higher counts in winter and summer.

Airlines' On-Time Performance: Some airlines consistently outperform others in punctuality. This is critical for benchmarking and improving standards.

Security Delays Across Airlines: Security-related delays are minimal but vary among airlines, suggesting a need for process streamlining or equipment upgrades for specific carriers.

Monthly Breakdown of Delays by Cause: The visual shows how delays from different causes evolve across months, aiding in root-cause analysis and targeted mitigation.

Delay Minutes: The cumulative delay minutes for major causes like weather and late aircraft highlight the economic impact of delays.

# Recommendations

Targeted Improvements at High-Delay Airports: Invest in infrastructure at airports with the most delays, especially during peak months. Collaborate with airlines to streamline operations at these hubs.

Carrier Performance Optimization: Airlines with high delay counts should focus on improving fleet turnaround times and crew efficiency. Incorporate predictive maintenance to reduce delays caused by late aircraft.

Weather Delay Mitigation: Enhance forecasting capabilities and develop contingency plans for adverse weather conditions. Consider airport-specific investments like de-icing systems or better runway management.

Passenger Experience: Improve communication channels to notify passengers about delay causes and provide alternatives promptly. Develop compensation strategies for passengers affected by frequent delays.

Data-Driven Policies: Use historical data trends to allocate resources effectively during high-delay periods.
